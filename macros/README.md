# Macros
Macros are shortcuts you can set up in Roll20.net to simplify things like rolling initiative for tokens, making saving throws, and many other things. This is a collection of macros I've found useful. I did not author all of them, but just wanted a place to collect them. You can read more about Roll20 macros generally [here](https://wiki.roll20.net/Macros).
