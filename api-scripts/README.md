# What Is This?
This is a collection of scripts I put together to accomplish repetive things in Roll20, such as making up NPCs on the fly and pseudo-rolling for random coinage to be found on the boddies of the slain or captured.

It uses the [Roll20.net API](https://wiki.roll20.net/API:Introduction), so you'll need that enabled in order to use these.
