# Roll Magic Item Tables

Sometimes an adventure tells you to roll on one of the magic item tables with letters A through I. This script automates that process for you. 

Usage: <code>!loot &lt;table_letter&gt;</code>

The script will roll a random number between 1 and 100 and return the name of an item from the specified table in a whisper to the GM.
